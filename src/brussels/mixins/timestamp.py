    """Mixin that adds automatic timestamp tracking columns.

    Inherits from MappedAsDataclass to support standalone usage without Base.
    When used with DataclassBase (which also inherits MappedAsDataclass), the
    duplicate inheritance is safely handled by Python's MRO (Method Resolution Order).

    All timestamp fields are excluded from __init__ (init=False) and are
    automatically managed by the database using UTC-aware datetimes.

    Usage:
        class MyModel(DataclassBase, PrimaryKeyMixin, TimestampMixin):
            __tablename__ = "my_table"
            name: Mapped[str]

    Fields:
        created_at: Set automatically on insert (UTC-aware)
        updated_at: Set automatically on insert and update (UTC-aware)
        deleted_at: NULL by default, set via mark_deleted() for soft deletion

    Soft Deletion:
        Use mark_deleted() to mark an entity as deleted without removing it
        from the database. Remember to commit the session after calling.
